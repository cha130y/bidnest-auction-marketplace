 * anything scheduled, or that an auction had just been won. Four columns say
 * what the site is doing right now in one glance, and each one is a way in to
 * the full section.
 *
 * One row rather than four stacked ones on purpose — `/auctions` already has
 * the tab strip for reading a section properly, so repeating all of it here
 * would push the products below the fold for no gain.
 *
 * The reads are `allSettled` and one auction deep: a section that is empty, or
 * one whose read fails, simply drops out of the row and the remaining columns
 * spread to fill it. An empty placeholder used to hold that spot, which was
 * worth it while the catalogue was thin; now that every section normally has
 * something, a dashed box reads as a hole rather than as information. If none
 * of the four has anything, the whole row goes away. The row is one Suspense
 * boundary on the page, so the four reads go out together.
